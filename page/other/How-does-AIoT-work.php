                        In AIoT devices, AI is embedded into infrastructure components, such as programs and chipsets, which are all connected using IoT networks. APIs are then used to ensure all hardware, software and platform components are able to operate and communicate together without effort from the end user.

                        <p>When operational, IoT devices create and gather data, and then AI analyzes it to provide insights and improve efficiencies and productivity. Insights are gained by AI using processes like data learning.</p>
                        <p>AIoT data can also be processed at the edge, meaning the data from IoT devices is processed as close to these devices as possible to minimize the bandwidth needed to move data while avoiding possible delays to data analysis.</p>

                        <p>Although many AIoT applications focus on the implementation of cognitive computing in consumer appliances, the following highlights several examples of the wider use of AIoT:</p>
                        <p>Smart cities. Smart technology such as sensors, lights and meters are used to collect data that is designed to help improve operational efficiency, drive economic growth and improve quality of life for residents.</p>
                        <p>Smart retail. Retailers use smart cameras to recognize shoppers' faces and detect if they have scanned their items at the self-checkout before leaving the store.</p>
                        <p>Smart home Smart appliances learn through human interaction and response. AIoT appliances can also store and learn from user data to understand user habits to provide customized support.</p>
                        <p>Enterprise and industrial. Manufacturers use smart chips to detect when equipment is not functioning properly, or a part needs to be replaced.</p>
                        <p>Social media and human resources (HR). AIoT tools can be integrated with social media and HR-related platforms to create an AI decision as a service function for HR professionals.</p>
                        <p>Autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles rely on multiple video camera and sensor systems to gather data about nearby vehicles, monitor driving conditions and look for pedestrians.</p>
                        <p>Autonomous delivery robots. Sensors gather data about the robot's environment, for example a warehouse, and then use AI to make traversal-based decisions.</p>
                        <p>Healthcare. Medical devices and wearables collect and monitor real-time health data, such as heart rate, and can delete irregular heartbeats.</p>
