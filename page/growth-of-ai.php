                        In the next four years, we expect AI’s industry growth will start to explode and its impact on business and society will begin to emerge.
                    </h2>
                    <div class="entry-content">
                        <p> By the end of the decade, we believe the recent rapid advances in AI will eventually plant progress firmly into the AGI phase – the beginning of true autonomy. AI-powered machines and software will likely start to untether from human supervision, embarking on their fateful path as sentient beings. But this will happen much later in the distant future. In the next four years, however, we believe AI's industry growth will start to explode and its impact on businesses and society will begin to emerge.</p>
                        <p>According to our estimates, the AI industry was a USD 5 billion marketplace by revenue in 2015, , a respectable size for such a budding sector. By 2020, we believe exponential improvements and broader adoption should more than double revenue to become a USD 12.5 billion industry. This represents a 20% annual growth rate. Assuming enterprise value/sales multiples of 10-15x, which is on par with other emerging fast-growing industries within the tech sector, AI as a standalone industry has the potential to claim a total market cap of USD 120-180 billion by 2020.</p>
                        <h3>AI software will create significant business opportunities and societal value.</h3>
                        <p>Software companies will take up the mantle and charge ahead, pushing the boundaries of automation, search and social media. Dubbed a machine's brain, AI will likely power automation in sectors like autonomous vehicles and unmanned drones. And AI software will create significant business opportunities and societal value.</p>
                        <p>For example, virtual assistants or chatbots will offer expert assistance; smart robots or robot advisors in the fields on finance, insurance, legal, media and journalism will provide instantaneous research or findings; and within the healthcare field, AI software will assist with medical diagnosis and assistance. Other benefits include significantly improving efficiencies in R&D projects by reducing time to market, optimizing transport and supply chain networks, and improving governance by better decision-making processes.</p>
                        <p>Already today, there are expert systems that can scan and share overviews of legal documents from obscure previous court rulings with lawyers within seconds, saving time and money. Autonomous driving, though still in the early stages, has also made tremendous progress; self-driving taxis were just recently launched in Singapore. And the list goes on, thus proving the inevitable ascendance of AI into our everyday lives.</p>
                        <h3>Are we at risk of being replaced?</h3>
                        <p><b>Technological unemployment is unfortunately a byproduct of progress.</b></p>
                        <p>Mechanized looms reduced artisan weavers to poverty, the tractor forced millions out of jobs and robotics has sliced countless workers in all types of manufacturing. The increasing integration of AI will ultimately yield greater productivity in the near term, the result of which has historically led to culls in employment.</p>
                        <p>The concerns are legitimate, but during this period AI will not nearly be at such a developmental stage that its widespread adoption will trigger mass layoffs. The technology will still be used in relatively niche applications and will not yet achieve a level of critical mass that would threaten employment on a global scale.</p>
