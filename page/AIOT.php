                        Artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) is the combination of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and the internet of things (IoT) infrastructure. AIoT's goal is to create more efficient IoT operations, improve human-machine interactions and enhance data management and analytics.

                        <p>AI is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems, and is typically used in natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision.</p>
                        <p>IoT is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines or objects with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. A thing in IoT can be a person's heart monitor implant, an automobile with built-in sensors to alert the driver when tire pressure is low, or any other object that can be assigned an Internet Protocol address and transfer data over a network.</p>
                        <p>AIoT is transformational and mutually beneficial for both types of technology, as AI adds value to IoT through machine learning capabilities and improved decision-making processes, while IoT adds value to AI through connectivity, signaling and data exchange. AIoT can improve businesses and their services by creating more value out of IoT-generated data. AI enables the IoT device to use gathered big data to better analyze, learn and make decisions without the need for a human.</p>

                        <h3>How does AIoT work?</h3>
                        <p>In AIoT devices, AI is embedded into infrastructure components, such as programs and chipsets, which are all connected using IoT networks. APIs are then used to ensure all hardware, software and platform components are able to operate and communicate together without effort from the end user.</p>
                        <p>When operational, IoT devices create and gather data, and then AI analyzes it to provide insights and improve efficiencies and productivity. Insights are gained by.. <a href="?p=other/How-does-AIoT-work">read more..</a></p>

                        <h3>What are the benefits and challenges of AIoT?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Benefits of AIoT include the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Increased operational efficiency. AI-integrated IoT devices can analyze data to reveal patterns and insights and adjust system operations to become more efficient.</li>
                            <li>Ability to adjust on the fly. Data can be generated and analyzed to identify points of failure, which enable the system to make adjustments as needed.</li>
                            <li>Data analytics done by AI. Employees do not have to spend as much time monitoring IoT devices, thus saving money.</li>
                            <li>Scalability. The number of devices connected to an IoT system can be increased to optimize existing processes or introduce new features.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>But there are also instances where AIoT may fail, causing a backup in production or other negative consequences. For example, autonomous delivery robots that fail might cause a delay in the delivery of a product; smart retail stores could fail to read a customer's face, leading to the customer accidently stealing a product; or an autonomous vehicle may fail to read its surroundings, like an oncoming stop sign, and cause an accident.</p>

                        <h3>What is the future of AIoT?</h3>
                        <p>With the integration of AI, IoT creates a much smarter system. The goal is to have these systems make accurate judgments without the need for human intervention. One of the bigger possible innovations in AIoT is the inclusion of 5G. 5G is designed to enable faster transfer of large data files in IoT devices, through its higher bandwidth and lower latency. AIoT could help solve existing operational problems, such as the expense associated with effective human capital management or the complexity of supply chains and delivery models</p>
