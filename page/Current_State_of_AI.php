                        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                        <p>
                            From search engine algorithms and customer support chatbots to enterprise apps and tools, AI is becoming a dependable and versatile technology. Despite the costs and other challenges of successful implementation, AI holds too much potential for it to be ignored.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Companies big and small use AI successfully to improve processes, analyze big data faster, and reduce human errors and labor. The results include tangible benefits for their customers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While AI adoption can vary considerably between countries and industries, 2019 has seen a growing interest in what remains one of the most exciting technologies in the software world.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the same time, however, AI has also raised ethical questions that brands that adopt it on a large scale now have to consider more carefully than before. AI governance, or the process of creating policies that address the negative implications of AI, will likely continue to attract attention until the capabilities of AI and their impact on human lives are fully defined.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Whether you’re already using AI implementations or not, one thing’s clear—ignoring AI in 2020 is quite impossible if you use a mobile device, browse your Facebook news feed, or shop online.
