                        Undoubtedly, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a revolutionary field of computer science, which is ready to become the main component of various emerging technologies like big data, robotics, and IoT.

                    <div class="entry-content">
                        <p>It will continue to act as a technological innovator in the coming years. In just a few years, AI has become a reality from fantasy. Machines that help humans with intelligence are not just in sci-fi movies but also in the real world. At this time, we live in a world of Artificial Intelligence that was just a story though for some years.</p>
                        <p>We are using AI technology in our daily lives either unknowingly or knowingly, and somewhere it has become a part of our life. Ranging from Alexa/Siri to Chatbots, everyone is carrying AI in their daily routine. The development and evolution of this technology are happening at a rapid pace. However, it was not as smooth and easy as it seemed to us. It has taken several years and lots of hard work & contributions of various people to take AI at this stage. Being so revolutionary technology, AI also deals with many controversies about its future and impact on Human beings. It may be dangerous, but also a great opportunity. AI will be deployed to enhance both defensive and offensive cyber operations. Additionally, new means of cyber-attack will be invented to take advantage of particular vulnerabilities of AI technology.</p>
                        <p>This topic will discuss the future of AI and its impact on human life, i.e., whether it is a great technology or a threat to humans</p>

                        <h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI) at Present</h3>
                        <p>
                            Before going deep dive into AI in future, first, let's understand what is Artificial Intelligence
                            and at what stage it is at present. We can define AI as, "It is the ability of machines or computer-controlled robot to perform task that are associated with intelligence." So, AI is computer science, which aims to develop intelligent machines that can mimic human behaviour.
                        </p>
                        <p>At the current stage, AI is known as Narrow AI or Weak AI, which can only perform dedicated tasks. For example, self-driving cars, speech recognition, etc.</p>
                        <p>AI will play a vital role in the healthcare sector for diagnosing diseases quickly and more accurately. New drug discovery will be faster and cost-effective with the help of AI. It will also enhance the patient engagement in their care and also make ease appointment scheduling, bill paying, with fewer errors. However, apart from these beneficial uses, one great challenge of AI in healthcare is to ensure its adoption in daily clinical practices.</p>
                        <p>The fully autonomous vehicle is not yet developed in the transportation sector, but researchers are reaching in this field. AI and machine learning are being applied in the cockpit to help reduce workload, handle pilot stress and fatigue, and improve on-time performance. There are several challenges to the adoption of AI in transportation, especially in areas of public transportation. There's a great risk of over-dependence on automatic and autonomous systems.</p>
                        <p>Artificial Intelligence will play a vital role in the e-commerce sector shortly. It will positively impact each aspect of the e-commerce sector, ranging from user experience to marketing and distribution of products. We can expect e-commerce with automated warehouse and inventory, shopper personalization, and the use of chatbots in future.</p>
