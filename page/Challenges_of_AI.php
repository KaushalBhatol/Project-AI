                        BIGGEST CHALLENGES IN THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE INDUSTRY
                    </h2>

                        <h3>Challenge #1 - Bias of AI Algorithms</h3>
                        <p>AI algorithms can show biased results when written by developers with biased minds. Since there isn’t any transparency about how the decision-making processes run in the background, the real users cannot be sure about its fairness. So, this can result in algorithms that yield biased results. </p>
                        <h3>
                            Challenge #2 - Lack of Privacy
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Most companies love data and they like to keep it. The privacy of citizens is constantly put at risk when companies collect consumer data without taking any prior permission — and this is made easy with the use of AI. Facial recognition algorithms are widely used across the world to support the functionality of different applications and products. Such products are collecting and selling huge amounts of customer data without consent.
                        </p>
                        <h3>
                            Challenge #3 - No Transparency
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Artificial Intelligence involves complex programming of products that cannot be explained to the common people. Moreover, algorithms of most of the AI-based products or applications are kept secret to avoid security breaches and similar threats. Due to these reasons, there is no transparency about the internal algorithms of AI products —making it difficult for customers to trust such products.
                        </p>
                        <h3>
                            Challenge #4 - Poor Governance & Accountability
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            When an AI system or product does something unethical, it’s challenging to assign blame or accountability. Earlier governance functions had to deal with static processes, but AI and data processes are iterative. Thus we need a governance process that can similarly adapt and change.
                        </p>
                        <h3>
                            Challenge #5 - The Curse of Data Annotation
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            A major chunk of artificial intelligence is based on the fact that tech companies train their computers using labeled data. Data Annotation/labeling requires a large human force and big tech giants like Google/Facebook hire a massive workforce who spend hours labeling the data. The irony here is that tech companies are trying to make smarter systems but they require substantial manual labor.
                        </p>
                        <h3>
                            Challenge #6 - Massive Training Datasets
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            The current AI-based applications not only require labeled data but also massive data. If you think about the biggest players in AI, which are, Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc they are leading because they have access to so much data. Not all companies have access to massive data.
                        </p>
                        <h3>
                            Challenge #7 - Quality of Data
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            There are many aspects to data quality, including consistency, integrity, accuracy, and completeness. Modern systems need to become aware of the quality of data I/O. They must instantly identify potential issues and avoid exposing dirty, inaccurate, or incomplete data to connected production components/ clients. This implies that, even if there is a sudden problematic situation resulting in poor-data quality entries, the system will be able to handle the quality issue and proactively notify the right users. Depending on how critical the issues are, it might also deny serving data to its clients — or serve data while raising the alert/ flagging the potential issues.
